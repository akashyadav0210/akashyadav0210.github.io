Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in [Uncertainty Quantification Group](https://uq.uh.edu/) at the University of Houston, advised by [Ruda Zhang](https://www.cive.uh.edu/faculty/zhang-ruda). 

My research is driven by a deep commitment to developing data-driven and probabilistic methods that improve the resilience and reliability of computational models in engineering. I focus on developing fast and efficient algorithms for quantifying and reducing model error in computational mechanics, enabling more accurate and trustworthy simulations for complex engineering applications.
