This year I got to attend my first ever NeurIPS and it felt like a rare convergence point where academic rigor and industrial momentum were clearly aligned around a shared objective: advancing the state of artificial intelligence in a responsible and impactful way. What stood out to me was not any single paper or product, but the collective energy in the hallways, workshops, and informal conversations. There was a sense that many people, regardless of background, were grappling with the same foundational questions about where the field is headed and how to shape it thoughtfully.

The expo floor captured this blend well. Industry exhibits showcased increasingly polished systems, while nearby discussions often circled back to fundamentals: data, alignment, robustness, and long-term impact. Even brief exchanges with strangers often turned into meaningful conversations about trade-offs, open problems, and lessons learned from work that did not go as planned.

A particularly memorable moment for me was meeting Geoffrey Hinton. I have followed his work for years, and encountering him in person was both surreal and grounding. The interaction itself was brief, but it carried a certain symbolic weight.


Overall, NeurIPS felt less like a traditional conference and more like a vibrant crossroads where ideas, people, and aspirations converged. It reinforced my belief that progress in AI will require not just technical breakthroughs, but also ongoing dialogue and collaboration across diverse communities. I left inspired and eager to contribute to this evolving landscape.
